# Showing-Quantum-Advantage-on-Pneumonia-Dataset-having-highly-reduced-number-of-features
The notebook CNN algorithms for Pneumonia detection is dedicated to processing image data, designing a CNN to detect pneumonia from these images, training this model, and then evaluating its performance with various metrics and visualizations. 
This involves a mix of image preprocessing, model construction, training, and analysis steps, typical for deep learning projects in medical image analysis.
The second notebook ("QCNN_Code_for_Pneumonia_Detection") explores a more experimental approach by integrating quantum computing principles with classical machine learning techniques for the same task. 
This hybrid method, signified by the use of quantum circuits and classical preprocessing, represents an advanced and innovative approach to machine learning tasks in medical imaging. â€‹
